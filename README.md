I created this project as a code sandbox to practice and learn React. I am new to React having been an Angular fanatic, but I have finally decided to give React a shot. I will be using commits and branching as a way to mark different feature/concept changes that I learn as I go, using them as reference for a later time.

So please excuse the noobness of this particular repository.

Cheers.
